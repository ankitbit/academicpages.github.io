Hi! I’m Ankit, a statistician and mathematician by training presently at the [Polytechnic University of Catalunya (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu) in Barcelona. I’m an interpretive social scientist by training with a background in the humanities, but I have just enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. As a statistician, I use many different qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods to holistically study and analyze datasets, devise novel methods for statistical learnng or at times attemting towards improving previous ones, while trying to uphold two goals: 1) to do research while embedded in the social worlds I study, and 2) to understand and assess the impact of the technology we develop on that social world. I will not hesitate to call myself computational statistician, because I mostly make attempts to use statistical computing for solving, supporting, interacting with, and relating to social problems in the areas of health, public policy etc.

I specialize in the area of statistical learning/machine learning algorithms that support the generation of intelligence  information and knowledge. Most of my previous work has been on diverse applications of statistical learnng in image processing, lingusitics, reliability enginering etc. I’ve also worked on applications of distributed computing frameworks which is often happening in parallel to my works on statistical learning. I also take interest in the study of algorithmic aspects such as fairness, transparency, acoountability, interpretability etc.

I received my B.S. from the [Birla Institute of Technology](http://www.bitmesra.ac.in), and M.S. from the [Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC)](http://www.upc.edu) and [Universitat de barcelona (UB)](http://www.ub.edu). I am fond of working at the intersection of many academic disciplines while integrating disciplines like mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, social science, and organization/management science with fields like philosophy, sociology, anthropology, and history of science and technology. In terms of academic specialties, I spend a lot of my time in the fields of Science and Technology Studies, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and new media / internet studies. Methodologically, while I am trained as a statistician, I also rely on other qualitative, quantitative, and computational methods from diverse fields of study such as artificial intelligence, . I often use more statistical forms of analysis to contextualize and further support more qualitative approaches, frequently collaborating with people from other disciplines. I frequently speak at conferences and events, and I also consult with various groups, organizations, and companies about a wide range of topics.
